<h3>Act III</h3>

<h3>ENDINGS</h3>

<h1>History, Setting and Lore</h1>

<h2>Cities</h2>

<h3>The Drown and its impact</h3>

<p>It’s been hundreds of years since the Drown, a near-apocalyptic flood that brought every city on Earth to its knees. Those that survived were forced to eke out a new life in the vast megastructures and skyscrapers that remained.</p>

<p>Buildings were hollowed out, retrofitted, rebuilt and secured. Places once used for work, for housing, for play, were now <em>the city itself</em>. Life in the 28th century is largely indoors.</p>

<p>Outside, people found ways to navigate around the canals; selling food, clothing, and themselves. Enterprising individuals and cartels built floating structures to offer some reprieve from the indoor cityscape, and construction teams created walkways between the buildings - the new streets of a strange city. In the depths below, divers and scavengers search for resources and treasures.</p>

<h3>New Venice</h3>

<p>The city our story takes place in is called New Venice, the result of an optimistic (or sarcastic) renaming effort by the new government. Despite the name, we’re nowhere near Italy, and happen to be somewhere in the continental United States. </p>

<p>Geography is a lot less important than it was in the old days though, and everyone has had to restructure how they think about the world. Countries no longer exist, geographically or politically. No, the surviving cities have become the new political seats of power as well as the only bastions of humanity left.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Politics</h2>

<h3>The world at large</h3>

<p>World governance efforts like the United Nations had largely collapsed in the aftermath of The Drown, and national governments toppled one-by-one as the floods raged.</p>

<p>In the post-Drown world, cities are typically overseen by a collective/government/leader. Depending on the entity, this leadership might entail the enforcement of laws, the running of organisations and welfare efforts, and more (or less) oversight on the activities of the denizens of the city. </p>

<p>This means some cities are totally anarchist in the way they are run, while others might be extremely totalitarian, with every shade of nuance existing in between. The way that person or group is elected (or if there are even elections at all) differ from city to city.</p>

<p>The closest entity to a United Nations that exists in the post-Drown world is the New Cities Collective, a group of 96 (out of of 149) new cities. The NCC organises and enacts trade and diplomatic efforts between its member cities. As travel between cities can be dangerous, all intercity travel must be approved by the NCC.</p>

<h3>The Fed</h3>

<p>New Venice is run by The Fed, a party that was first democratically elected about twenty years before our story starts, and has been re-elected every term ever since. </p>

<p>The Fed’s main objective, at least to the public, is to restore New Venice to the glory of its pre-Drown days. They couldn’t sweep up the sea, but they could build a new world on top of it. A tantalising prospect, and just believable enough that citizens might just buy into it, even if none of them were even alive to see the city on dry land.</p>

<p>What the Fed is actually doing is a lot less utopian. Over many decades, even before they ran the city, The Fed’s head honchos were slithering into every corner of commerce in New Venice. Every marketeer, every serviceman, even the Security Corps, had investment by Fed members - investment they could pull at any moment.</p>

<p>On top of this, the Fed is rumoured to have more direct means of punishment for detractors, with many disappearing or being publicly defamed.</p>

<p>Now that they run the place, their chokehold on New Venice is more secure than ever.</p>

<h3>Opposition to The Fed</h3>

<p>The Fed doesn’t really see regular members of the public as a threat, and so there are many vocal opponents to The Fed in civilian spaces. Many groups have formed to challenge their reign, either officially by running in the (possibly pointless) elections or unofficially through the formation of orgs and gangs.</p>

<h4>New Venetian Collectivists</h4>

<p>The main opposition to The Fed. This group takes part in the elections while running many social initiatives, striving to fill in the gaps left by The Fed’s apathetic social services. The NVC have no leader, and there are chapters across many of the larger scrapers in New Venice. Internal governance and planning is achieved democratically with the members of each chapter having a say in the NVC’s efforts. </p>

<p>As the name suggests, NVC is opposed to the capitalist activities that The Fed relishes in and relies upon, insisting that the continuation of the human race can only be achieved through socialist means.</p>

<h4>MMXV</h4>

<p>MMXV is a more esoteric group, based on adherence to the tenets and principles found in a text from 2015 CE called <em>Cycle</em>. Initially lost to The Drown, the data-cart containing it was recovered on a diving expedition in New Venice. Its author is unknown, and the work itself is unfinished. </p>

<p>To non-MMXV citizens, it reads like the ramblings of a madman, to others it reads like a second-rate fantasy novel. To MMXV adherents, it is <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

<p>Little is known about the inner workings of MMXV, but their outer workings are a lot less mysterious. </p>

<p>Adherents can be found everywhere in the sprawling city, preaching a return to older ways of living. They despise the gender-freedom, the sexual “deviance”, and the sex work that runs rampant in the city, believing it is what caused The Drown in the first place.</p>

<p>MMXV adherents do not believe in a god, per se, rather it seems that they personify the Earth itself as being spoiled by the excess and deviance of mankind. This is the basis of their beliefs, the idea that to restore nature, humans must return to their “natural” ways of being. According to sources close to the org, women are not allowed to join MMXV, but are allowed to campaign for it. Through their public efforts, it is clear that non-heterosexual and non-cisgender people are not recognised by MMXV, and are “condemned”. </p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>The future of <em>THIS CITY SWEATS</em> is filled with technological advances. Some borne out of necessity, many innovated post-Drown to deal with the new normal. There’s tech for pleasure, tech for pain, and a cottage industry of questionable/unethical/illegal tech sold on a very active black market.</p>

<p>Here are some of the basic tech concepts and items that we’ll encounter in the story.</p>
